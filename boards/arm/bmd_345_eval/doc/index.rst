Hardware
********

BMD-345 on the BMD-345-EVAL board has an internal high frequency oscillator
at 32MHz and external slow frequency oscillator at 32.768kHz.

Front End Module
================

BMD-345 utilizes the skyworks RFX2411 front end module (FEM) also known as PA/LNA.
The FEM provides higher output power and better sensitivity.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``bmd_345_eval`` board configuration can be
built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the board nRF52840 DK
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bmd_345_eval
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic boards with a
Segger IC.


Testing the LEDs and buttons in the BMD 345 EVAL
************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

.. code-block:: console

   samples/basic/blinky
   samples/basic/button

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/bmd_345_eval/bmd_345_eval.dts`.

Using UART1
***********

The following approach can be used when an application needs to use
more than one UART for connecting peripheral devices:

1. Add devicetree overlay file to the main directory of your application:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cat bmd_345_eval.overlay
      &uart1 {
        compatible = "nordic,nrf-uarte";
        current-speed = <115200>;
        status = "okay";
        tx-pin = <14>;
        rx-pin = <16>;
      };

   In the overlay file above, pin P0.16 is used for RX and P0.14 is used for TX

2. Use the UART1 as ``device_get_binding(DT_LABEL(DT_NODELABEL(uart1)))``

See :ref:`set-devicetree-overlays` for further details.

Selecting the pins
==================
To select the pin numbers for tx-pin and rx-pin:

.. code-block:: console

   tx-pin = <pin_no>

Open the `nRF52840 Product Specification`_, chapter 7 'Hardware and Layout'.
In the table 7.1.1 'aQFN73 ball assignments' select the pins marked
'General purpose I/O'.  Note that pins marked as 'low frequency I/O only' can only be used
in under-10KHz applications. They are not suitable for 115200 speed of UART.

Translate the 'Pin' into number for devicetree by using the following formula::

   pin_no = b\*32 + a

where ``a`` and ``b`` are from the Pin value in the table (Pb.a).
For example, for P0.1, ``pin_no = 1`` and for P1.0, ``pin_no = 32``.
